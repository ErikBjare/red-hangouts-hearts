With the launch of a Google Hangouts update that came somewhen before 2015/04/21 the chat-service changed their default hearts (what <3 translates into) to a horribly purple one.
I have no idea why, but my girlfriend didn't like it, and neither did I. So this is a fix which simply applies a CSS `hue-rotate(90deg)` filter, effectively making the hearts red.
